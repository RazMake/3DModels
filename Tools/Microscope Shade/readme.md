I got a [LCD microscope](https://www.banggood.com/Andonstar-ADSM201-1080P-Full-HD-USB-Microscope-Magnifier-Long-Object-Distance-Microscope-p-1111802.html?rmmds=myorder&cur_warehouse=USA),
which has its own lights to illuminate the subject.  
Those lights are bright and they where blinding me when switching between looking at the object directly and through the microscope.  
I decided to design and print a shade, to help with this problem:
