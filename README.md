# Description
This is my repository of 3D print related stuff. I opted to not use Thingiverse after at some point I tried and failed to upload some design for a number of times, due to bugs in the platform.
For each 3d model I try to have the Fusion360 file, STL(s) and the 3mf file (so at least the settings that I used when printing it are there).  
This is also where I keep paramter packs that I commonly use (like tolerances or dimensions of various components that I often integrate).

# Disclaimer
These are the exact files I have used so they did work for me, they are not meant for commercial use and I make no guarantee that they will work for you.  
Tha various components have various degrees of *'cleanness'* and they all are printed with a [Prusa MK3S](https://shop.prusa3d.com/en/3d-printers/180-original-prusa-i3-mk3-kit.html?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Shopping%20USA&utm_term=4580084407128979&utm_content=mk3s#/40-spring_steel_sheet-spring_steel_sheet_with_smooth_double_sided_pei_sheet/7-color-black_and_orange) printer.  
I assume no responsiblity for anything bad happening as a result of printing these or using the prited parts.
